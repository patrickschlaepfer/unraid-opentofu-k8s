# unraid-opentofu-k8s

Project to set up a Kubernetes Cluster on unraid.
It might not sound like a good idea having a cluster
on a single node. But to learn, test or use it as homelab
I think it might be a some sort of approach.

For the kubernetes part, I try to use 
Canonical Kubernetes, which should include some basic services.

## opentofu

Contains the Opentofu files, to set up your VMs.
